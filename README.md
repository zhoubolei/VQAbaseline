# Simple Baseline for Visual Question Answering
![teaser results](http://visualqa.csail.mit.edu/framework.jpg)
We descrive a very simple bag-of-words baseline for visual question answering. The description of the baseline is in the arXiv paper http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02167.pdf


The code is developed by Bolei Zhou and Yuandong Tian.

Demo is available at http://visualqa.csail.mit.edu/



To train the model using the code, the following data of the VQA dataset are needed:
- The pre-processed data of text is at http://visualqa.csail.mit.edu/data_vqa_txt.zip
- The googlenet feature of all the COCO images is at http://visualqa.csail.mit.edu/data_vqa_feat.zip
